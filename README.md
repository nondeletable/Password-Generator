# 🔐 Password Generator

A simple and secure desktop application for generating strong passwords.  
Built with **Python + Flet**, works fully offline, customizable, and includes a built-in strength indicator.

---

## ✨ Features
- Password generation using the [`secrets`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html) module (cryptographically secure).
- Flexible configuration: letters, digits, symbols.
- Guaranteed inclusion of at least one character from each selected category.
- Password strength indicator with visual cues (❌ weak / ⚠️ fair / ✅ strong).
- ⏱️ **Auto-hide**: when a password is shown, it disappears after **10 seconds**.
- 🧹 **Clipboard protection**: copied passwords are automatically removed from the clipboard after **30 seconds**.
- 📋 One-click copy to clipboard.
- 🖥️ Clean and modern user interface.
- 🛡️ **Password Policies**:
  - **Standard** — balanced complexity (letters, digits, symbols).
  - **Admin** — stronger rules for administrator accounts.
  - **NIST** — compliant with [NIST SP 800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/) guidelines (longer, user-friendly but secure).
